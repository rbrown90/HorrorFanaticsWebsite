                    <p>Welcome Horror Fanatic, where the last horror you watched is the next one we want to see!
                    Horror Fanatic is a fan ran website that is about pointing those of us who love horror movie 
                    to our next thrill. This website is about the appreciation of all types of horror movies. From psychological 
                    to more monster oriented horror themes, we love them all. We seek out to build the biggest collection of horror movies
                    on the internet, haha. All your horror needs can be meet in one place!</p>

                    <br>

                    <p> So, how does "Horror Fanatic" work? Well, I'm happy you asked. This website is ran an maintained totally in house by people
                    just like you! Most of the movies we have suggested or movies we have seen and loved personally. We have a problem though... We haven't seen 
                    them all and that's where you come in! Located on this website is a page called "Add Title" where you can suggest a favorite or recently seen horror
                    movie that you think the rest of us would love to also enjoy the fright. If the movies passes the horror movie credentials (we aren't here to watch The Notebook, right?),
                    then your movie will be recommended to other site visitors on our front page!</p>

                    <br>

                    <p> Last but not least, this site is updated bi-weekly. So if you recommended something and don't see it within the next few days, don't worry. We are an ever growing site,
                    so we will be changing and adapting the website to fit the pace. We are so happy that you have decided to visit us and we hope that you find some delightful scares with us.
                    Remember to stay away from Dark alleys and haunted alleys... We hope you survive until next time!</p>

                    <br>

                    Sincerly,
                    <br>
                    Your favorite undead staff
